**Privacy Policy for Local Lens**

**Last Updated:** January 7, 2026

**1. Data Collection and Usage**

Local Lens is a privacy-first extension designed to run entirely on your device.

- **Website Content:** The extension captures screenshots of the active tab only when you explicitly trigger the "crop" action. These images are processed locally within your browser using Tesseract.js to extract text.
- **No Data Transmission:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your screenshots, extracted text, or browsing history to any external servers. All processing happens in your browser's memory and local storage.

**2. Third-Party Services**

- **Tesseract.js Language Data:** The extension may download static language training files (`.traineddata`) from `https://tessdata.projectnaptha.com` to support Optical Character Recognition (OCR). No user data is sent to this service; it is a one-way download of configuration files.

**3. Contact**
